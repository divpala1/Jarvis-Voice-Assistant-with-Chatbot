# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant-with-Chatbot
This is Python project of a voice assistant with the implementation of a chatbot which uses neural network.

The code has been commented properly to help coders understand the code better.

FILES IN THE PROJECT:  
-> 1. Chatbot_training.py  
-> 2. Jarvis.py  
-> chatbot.py  
-> intents.json  

CAPABILITIES:  
-> Searching in Wikipedia (preferred command: "ThingYouWantToSearch in wikipedia").  
-> Opening Google, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter in default browser ("Open Google").  
-> Play music.  
-> Knowing what time it is at the moment (preferred command: "What is the time now?").  
-> Opening programs from PC. Edit the code on line 163 for your custom programs.  
-> Sending Emails.  
-> Reply to regular talks like 'Hello, How are you?, How old are you?, etc.'  

RUNNING THE PROJECT:  
-> Run the files in the order of indexing. So first run 'Chatbot_training.py' and then 'Jarvis.py'.  
-> 'Chatbot_training.py' only needs to be run once i.e. when the project is opened for the first time. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:  
-> Before the first run, open Jarvis.py, search for the word "PATH", and add all the necessary paths for proper functionality.  
-> For the email functionality, create a 'mail.txt' file which contains the email (in the first line) and password (in the second line) of your email account. Add the path to it in the 'send email' function in Jarvis.py.  
-> To add more commands for chatbot functionality, edit the 'intents.json' file.  
-> User needs to run the '1. Chatbot_training.py' only once i.e. when the project is opened for the first time. Then one only needs to open the '2. Jarvis.py' for regular use.  

THANK YOU
